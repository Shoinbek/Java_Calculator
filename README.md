# Java_Calculator
This Java program implements a simple calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers. 
The program prompts the user to input two numbers and choose a mathematical operation. It then performs the selected operation on the given numbers and displays the result.

**How it Works**:

The program starts by welcoming the user to the calculator and prompting for the first and second numbers.

Input validation is performed to ensure that the user enters valid numeric values.

The program then prompts the user to choose a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

Based on the chosen operation, the program performs the corresponding calculation on the provided numbers.

The result of the calculation is displayed to the user.

If the user inputs an invalid operation, they are prompted to try again until a valid operation is selected.
